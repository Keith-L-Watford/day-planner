# Day Planner
## Description
I was assigned to create a day planner. I used this project as further practice in JavaScript and to familiarize myself a little with moment.js. Although, my js logic seems to work as it should, this interation of the planner isn't DRY at all. Hopefully in the future Ill be able to refactor this project.

## Installation
No installs required. Works best on an updated browser.

## Usage
Type into any block your plans for the day and then hit the save button. Your list items should be saved into your local storage and the next time you come to the page, your previous entries should be right where you left them.

## Credits
Shout out to teacher Leif for helping me retreive my data from local storage. The fix was that I needed to move the call function of the function itself.
